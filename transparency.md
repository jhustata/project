# Complete transparency with zero disclosure risk 
- [WebApp](https://abikesa.github.io/quickdeploy/)
- Input avaiable in public repo on GitHub
  
### Minimizing disclosure risk
- Original dataset had this granularity $9000\times \4$
- Including individuals observations
- But the WebApp only includes $5\times \1$
- That represents "dimensionality" reduction
- Have we lost any important information?

### Optimizing access to our work
- We can now open our "safe" data to the world and encourage conversation
- Visitors to our site can test hypotheses beyond our imagination
- Science can make progress on account of our "catalyst" role
  
### Encoding all the data in parameters
- Machine learning may do a better job here
- But for now we'll start with our speculation about what variables matter for our key hypothesis
